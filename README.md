Git description 
what is a Repository ? 
The repository is like a file system. The file system works like a tree algorithm, (there is a root that act like a parent and child and those children have a leave node. we use a repository that contains a directory and subdirectory that keeps the history of all the edits we made in the project. This is particularly useful since we have the ability to go back if we make a mistake and get stuck in a project.GIt has filesystem that has both local and remote .
